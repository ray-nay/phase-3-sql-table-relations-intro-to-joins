# SQL Joins

## Learning Goals

- Describe how SQL join clauses combine data from multiple tables based on a
  common column between them
- Define the common types of SQL joins: `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`
- Practice writing join statements

## Introduction

We'll discuss how to retrieve specific sets of data from associated tables using
SQL join statements.

to code along.

## What Is a JOIN?

A SQL `JOIN` clause is a way to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a
common column between them. The great thing about relational databases is that
they are just that––_relational_. Relational databases allow us not only to
store data that is interconnected, but to retrieve that data in ways that
reflect that interconnectivity.

Let's say, for example, we have two tables, a `cats` table and an `owners`
table. Cats and owners are associated by a **foreign key** of `owner_id` in the
`cats` table. How would we craft a query that would grab us all of the cats with
a particular owner, and even include information about that owner in the data
returned to us by that query?

We know how to write a `SELECT` statement that gets us all of the cats with a
particular `owner_id`. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE owner_id = 2;
```

This would return us the appropriate list of cats. But what if we wanted to
query _both_ the `cats` and the `owners` tables and return information about
both cats and owners? This is where `JOIN` statements come in.

## JOIN Types

There are two common types of joins that we will cover in this lesson. The
following JOIN keywords will be used along with `SELECT` statements to achieve
the described return values.

| Type              | Description                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| INNER JOIN        | Returns all rows when there is at least one match in BOTH tables                |
| LEFT (OUTER) JOIN | Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table |

In the following code-along, we'll be crafting JOIN statements of both of the
above types in order to return data about a series of connected database tables.

For this code-along, we'll be working with the database of pets and owners that
we created in the last exercise. It's available here in the `pets_database.db`
file.

For the rest of this code along, you can run the SQL commands in your terminal
from the `sqlite3` prompt, or you can open the `pets_database.db` file in DB
Browser for SQLite, and run the SQL commands from the "Execute SQL" tab.

### A Reminder on Foreign Keys

Note that the `cats` table has an `owner_id` column. This column is a **foreign
key** that connects each cat to an individual owner. If an individual cat has an
`owner_id` of `2`, that indicates that that cat belongs to the owner who has an
`id` of `2`.

To confirm this, you can run the following `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE owner_id = 2;
```

You should see just one cat returned to us, the one that belongs to Sophie, our
second owner:

```txt
id               name             age         breed          owner_id
---------------  ---------------  ----------  -------------  ----------
3                Nona             4           Tortoiseshell  2
```

**NOTE**: To output your query results in this format in the `sqlite3` prompt,
enter the following settings before running your query:

```txt
sqlite> .headers on
sqlite> .mode column
sqlite> .width auto
```

## Code Along I: INNER JOIN

### Definition

An `INNER JOIN` query will return _all_ the rows from both tables you are querying
where a certain condition is met. In other words, `INNER JOIN` will select all
rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the specified columns
of each table.

Let's take a look at a boiler-plate `INNER JOIN` statement, before we try it out
on our `pets_database`:

```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM first_table
INNER JOIN second_table
ON first_table.column_name = second_table.column_name;
```

This may not make sense to you just yet. Let's try it out with our own database
in order to gain a better understanding.

### Writing INNER JOINs

Let's write an INNER JOIN query that will return the name and breed of
the cat along with the name of that cat's owner:

```sql
SELECT cats.name, cats.breed, owners.name
FROM cats
INNER JOIN owners
ON cats.owner_id = owners.id;
```

Let's break this down:

```sql
SELECT cats.name, cats.breed, owners.name
```

Here, we are specifying which columns from each table we want to select data
from. We use the `table_name.column_name` notation to grab columns from two
different tables.

Next up, we join our two tables together with our `INNER JOIN` keyword:

```sql
FROM cats
INNER JOIN owners
```

Lastly, we tell our query _how_ to connect, or join, the two tables. In other
words, we tell our query which columns in each table function as the foreign
key/primary key. Through this, our query will correctly identify which cat
belongs to which owner and return that information accordingly.

```sql
ON cats.owner_id = owners.id;
```

Here, we are telling our query that the `owner_id` column on the Cats table is
filled with data that corresponds to data in the `id` column of the Owners
table. We are indicating that a value of `1`, for example, in an individual
cat's `owner_id` column refers to the individual owner who has an `id` of `1`.
And we are telling our query to return _only_ those cats and owners who share
this connection.

The above statement should return the following:

```sql
name             breed            name
---------------  ---------------  ----------
Maru             Scottish Fold    mugumogu
Hana             Tabby            mugumogu
Nona             Tortoiseshell    Sophie
```

We did it! We wrote an `INNER JOIN` query that returns to us all of the data in
the specified columns from both tables.

Notice that the owner's name column is called `name` in the output above. That
is because we requested the `name` column from the `owners` table. For this
particular output though, it would be great if the column could read
"owners_name", to distinguish it from the cat's name column.

Let's run that query again, this time aliasing the `name` column of the `owners`
table as `owners_name`, using the `AS` keyword:

```sql
SELECT
  cats.name,
  cats.breed,
  owners.name AS "owner_name"
FROM cats
INNER JOIN owners
ON cats.owner_id = owners.id;
```

This should return:

```sql
name             breed            owner_name
---------------  ---------------  ----------
Maru             Scottish Fold    mugumogu
Hana             Tabby            mugumogu
Nona             Tortoiseshell    Sophie
```

You can visualize what's happening with an `INNER JOIN` like this:

![INNER JOIN Venn Diagram](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sql-table-relations-intro-to-joins/inner-join.png)

When using an `INNER JOIN` to return data from multiple tables, you will only
see the results from records in the first table (left side of the diagram above)
and the second table (right side) when they can be connected via a foreign key;
that is, when our `cats` table has an `owner_id` that corresponds with an `id`
in the `owners` table.

### A Note on INNER JOINs, or, Where's Lil' Bub?

When we say that an `INNER JOIN` returns all of the data for which a certain
condition is true, we mean that any data that does not meet a `JOIN` condition
will not be returned. The `JOIN` condition, in this case, is the thing that our
two tables are joined `ON`:

```sql
ON cats.owner_id = owners.id;
```

Our query, therefore, will select all of the appropriate data concerning cats
and owners who _are_ joined by an `owner_id`/`id` foreign key/primary key
relationship. In other words, it will select all of the cats who have a value in
the `owner_id` column that matches a value in the `id` column of the `owners`
table. Any cats that have an empty `owner_id` column, or have a value in that
column that does not match the `id` of an existing owner, will not be selected
by the query.

You might have noticed that the data returned by our query did not include Lil'
Bub. That's because when we inserted Lil' Bub into our `cats` table, we didn't
give her an `owner_id`:

```txt
id          name        age         breed          owner_id
----------  ----------  ----------  -------------  ----------
1           Maru        3           Scottish Fold  1
2           Hana        1           Tabby          1
3           Nona        4           Tortoiseshell  2
4           Lil' Bub    2           perma-kitten
```

![Lil' Bub](<http://readme-pics.s3.amazonaws.com/Lil_Bub_2013_(crop_for_thumb).jpg>)

Other types of `JOIN` statements, however, can return such data.

## Code Along 2: LEFT JOIN

I don't know about you, but I miss Lil' Bub. It would be nice if we could query
our database for both cat and owner information _without_ excluding her. With a
`LEFT JOIN` we can do just that.

### `LEFT JOIN` Definition

A `LEFT JOIN` query returns _all_ rows from the left, or first, table,
regardless of whether or not they met the `JOIN` condition. The query will also
return the matched data from the right, or second, table.

In the case of data from the first table that doesn't meet our `JOIN` condition,
the resulting output will include `NULL`, or empty, values for the missing
matched columns.

Let's take a look at a boiler-plate `LEFT JOIN`:

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM first_table
LEFT JOIN second_table
ON first_table.column_name = second_table.column_name;
```

Now let's try it out on our `pets_database`.

### Writing `LEFT JOIN`s

Execute the following command:

```sql
SELECT cats.name, cats.breed, owners.name
FROM cats
LEFT OUTER JOIN owners
ON cats.owner_id = owners.id;
```

You should see the following output returned to you:

```txt
name             breed            name
---------------  ---------------  ----------
Maru             Scottish Fold    mugumogu
Hana             Tabby            mugumogu
Nona             Tortoiseshell    Sophie
Lil' Bub         perma-kitten
```

Here, our `LEFT JOIN` has returned to us _all_ of the cats (including Lil'
Bub!), with matched data regarding owner's name for those cats that have an
owner, and empty space in the owner's name column for the cat that doesn't have
an owner.

Here's a visualization of a `LEFT JOIN`:

![LEFT JOIN Venn Diagram](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sql-table-relations-intro-to-joins/left-join.png)

As you can see, with a left join, all the data is returned from the first table
_regardless_ of whether there's a foreign key match in the second table. We get
back all the data from the `cats` data, and we get data from the `owners` table
when our `cats` table has an `owner_id` that corresponds with an `id` in the
`owners` table.

## Other `JOIN` Types

Some SQL databases support two other types of joins: `RIGHT JOIN` and
`FULL JOIN`. These are far less common than `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` — in
fact, SQLite doesn't support these types of joins, and it's very rare that you
will need to use them. You can read more about these other join types
[here][sql joins], if you're curious!

## Conclusion

With `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`, along with our knowledge of primary keys
and foreign keys, we now have all the tools at our disposal to access data
across related tables using SQL! These concepts will also translate back to
our object oriented Ruby code once we start using Active Record, and knowing
how tables relate is essential when it comes to creating the different tables
you will need to effectively store data for your applications.
